Have you ever been sent an R script by a colleague and the code fails to run as promised? Or have you ever re-run one of your own scripts after a few weeks, and you get a new error or different results to last time? This has happened to pretty much every R user, but it is avoidable! In this session, we cover some top-tips for ensuring that the R scripts you write today will run again in the same way tomorrow (both for yourself, and colleagues). 

## Material

The material for the session is available [here](https://github.com/langtonhugh/reprod_r).


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
