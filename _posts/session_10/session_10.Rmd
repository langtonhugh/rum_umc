In this session we will learn how to build a personal (academic) website using the `distill` package. The live demonstration will be loosely based on [this material](https://aosmith16.github.io/spring-r-topics/slides/week02_distill_websites.html#1) from [Ariel Muldoon](https://ariel.rbind.io/).

## Material

The material for the session is available [here](https://github.com/langtonhugh/demo_website). This contains the source material for the website we build during the session itself.
