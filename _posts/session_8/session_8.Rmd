Thomas maintains an R package called [splithalfr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/splithalfr/index.html), which features some bespoke resampling methods ([Pronk et al., 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-021-01948-3)). To make sure everything in the package works correctly, heâ€™s written a few unit tests. In this RUM-UMC session, Thomas will give a beginner-friendly introduction to unit testing in R, illustrated by the [splithalfr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/splithalfr/index.html) package. Following that, we will briefly dip our toes into test automation via [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/)

## Material

The material for the session will be available soon!
