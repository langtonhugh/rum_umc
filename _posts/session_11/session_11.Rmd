In this session we will use various data visualisation skills to explore the all-important question: **has The Simpsons got worse over time?**. We do this using data scraped from IMDB that has been made available [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hod101s/simpsons-imdb-ratings?resource=download).

## Material

The material for the session is available [here](https://github.com/langtonhugh/rum_umc/tree/main/session_material/scripts). This contains a complete prep script and the script used during the live demonstration itself.
