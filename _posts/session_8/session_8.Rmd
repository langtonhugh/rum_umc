This session will cover software testing. Thomas maintains an R-package called [splithalfr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/splithalfr/index.html), which features a lot of resampling conducted in very particular ways ([Pronk et al., 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-021-01948-3)). To ensure that the software functions as expected, and stays like that as code is modified, Thomas wrote various tests. During this session, he will describe the testing strategy for [splithalfr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/splithalfr/index.html), incorporating unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Thomas will also offer a primer on how to automate unit testing via the [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) R-package.

## Material
