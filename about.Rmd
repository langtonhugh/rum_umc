This is the webpage for RUM-UMC, the R user meet-up for [Amsterdam UMC](https://www.amsterdamumc.org/en/organization/amsterdam-umc.htm). The goal of the group is to connect fellow R enthusiasts from across the university, share our knowledge, refine best practices, learn new stuff and have fun.

Anyone is welcome to join the meet-ups, from beginners to seasoned pros. If you'd like to attend, present something, or raise a topic for discussion, please [get in touch](mailto:m.c.postema@amsterdamumc.nl).
