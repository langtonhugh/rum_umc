In this session, we kick-off the R user meeting for Amsterdam UMC (RUM-UMC) with personal introductions, a conversation to find out people's preferences for format and timings (e.g., frequency of meets, hybrid), followed by a live coding demonstration for [tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
